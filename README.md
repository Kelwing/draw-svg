# draw-svg

draw-svg is a basic package to draw SVG's on [gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) contexts.

It may be feature complete someday, and code definitely needs some cleanup to make it more readable,
but it does function for some basic SVG's.  It was created for use in [pfp.lgbt](https://pfp.lgbt)
